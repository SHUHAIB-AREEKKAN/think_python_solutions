PREFACE


The native trees of West Virginia number about 125, of which 101 are
described and illustrated in this publication. The omissions are
principally species of unimportant willows and hawthorns which can be
identified only by specialists. Some of the more common introduced
trees are mentioned in the family descriptions on pages 13 to 27, and a
few are illustrated in groups after the descriptions of native species.
It has been the object to simplify everything in this publication as
much as possible. The meaning of unfamiliar words in the keys and
descriptions can be learned by consulting the glossary beginning on
page 237.

The keys are based principally on characters of leaf and fruit since
these are usually available for study during several months in the
summer and fall. The text, however, contains brief descriptions of the
flowers which often denote most surely the natural relationship of
species.

Scientific names and the order of arrangement are essentially those of
the seventh edition of Gray’s New Manual of Botany.

The drawings were made by the writer from specimens collected during
the past few years.

This bulletin has been prepared mainly for those who desire to become
more familiar with our native and introduced trees, but who do not have
access to the larger publications on the subject. It will serve also as
a basis for future forestry studies in the State. Popular interest in
forestry, which is sadly lacking in West Virginia at this time, will be
stimulated by a more general and more intimate acquaintance with the
different kinds of trees. It is hoped that this bulletin will help to
create the needed interest. If difficulty is found in determining the
name of any tree, specimens mailed to the West Virginia Agricultural
Experiment Station, Morgantown, West Virginia, will be named, if
possible, without charge.

PINACEAE—THE PINE FAMILY


The Pine family comprises nearly 300 species belonging to 34 genera,
distributed principally in temperate regions throughout the world. This
family is of great economic importance, supplying a larger quantity of
lumber than any other family as well as enormous amounts of tannin,
turpentine, resin, tar and pitch. Many of its members also are highly
useful for ornamental purposes.

The leaves of the trees and shrubs belonging to the Pine family are
needle-shaped, awl-shaped, or scale-like, and are usually persistent
for more than one year, the American Larch or Tamarack being the only
exception to this rule in West Virginia. The seeds are borne either in
true cones, or in berry-like fruits such as are produced on the cedars.

The following are the genera of Pinaceae represented in West Virginia:

=Pinus=.—Of the 34 species of pines native to North America only 5
are found in West Virginia. These are described and illustrated on
following pages. Besides the native pines several introduced species
are planted on lawns and in parks. The most common of the exotics are
Red Pine (_Pinus resinosa_, Ait.) and Scotch Pine (_Pinus sylvestris_,
L.), the former having smooth cones about 2 inches long and leaves 4-6
inches long, two in a bundle, and the latter having cones 1½-2½ inches
long, and leaves 1½-3½ inches long, two in a bundle.

KEY TO THE SPECIES OF PINUS

Leaves 5 in a cluster; cones smooth, 4-10 inches long =P. strobus, p. 29.=

Leaves fewer than 5 in a cluster; cones less than 4 inches long.

  Leaves 3 in a cluster; cones with prickles      =P. rigida, p. 31.=

  Leaves 2 in a cluster.

    Leaves stiff, sharp-pointed, 2-4 inches long; cones 2-4 inches
    long with very thick sharp spines      =P. pungens, p. 33.=

    Leaves twisted 1½-3½ inches long; cones 2-3 inches long;
    scales terminated with prickles      =P. virginiana, p. 37.=

    Leaves slender, not twisted, 3-4 inches long, often 3 in a cluster,
    especially near the ends of twigs      =P. echinata, p. 35.=

=Larix=, (page 39).—There are 10 known species of Larches found
principally in the colder regions of the northern hemisphere. Three of
these are indigenous to North America and one extends as far south as
the northern part of West Virginia. Unlike most of the members of the
Pine family the Larches shed their leaves each fall. The European Larch
(_Larix decidua_, Mill.) is frequently planted for ornamental purposes.
It can be distinguished from the native species by its much larger
cones.

=Picea=, (page 41).—Eight of the 18 or 20 known species of Spruces are
native to North America and one species is found in West Virginia. The
2 introduced Spruces most commonly planted are Norway Spruce (_Picea
Abies_, (L.) Karst.) and Colorado Blue Spruce (_Picea pungens_, Engl.).
The Norway Spruce can be distinguished from our native species by its
much larger cones, and the Colorado Blue Spruce by its blue-green
foliage.

=Tsuga=, (page 43).—This genus comprises 8 species, 4 of which grow in
Asia and 4 in North America. One of the 2 Eastern Hemlocks is common in
West Virginia, the other (_Tsuga caroliniana_, Engl.) grows from the
mountains of Virginia south to Georgia.

=Abies=, (page 45).—The 25 known species of Firs are found principally
in cold and temperate regions. Of the 10 species in North America only
2 are found east of the Rocky Mountains and 1 in West Virginia. The
other Eastern Fir is _Abies balsamea_, (L.) Mill, which does not extend
southward into this State.

=Thuja=, (page 47).—Four species of Arbor Vitae are known, 2 of which
are native to North America, one in the West and the other in the East.
The limited distribution in West Virginia of the latter is given on the
page describing this species.

=Juniperus=, (page 49).—This is a large genus comprising 40 trees and
shrubs. Of these, 16 species are found in North America. Red Cedar,
described in this bulletin, is common in West Virginia and _Juniperus
communis_, (L.) has been reported from Wood, Mineral and Fayette
counties.

Other members of the Pine family which may be seen occasionally planted
on lawns in West Virginia are the following:

White Cedar (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_, (L.) B.S.P.)

Bald Cypress (_Taxodium distichum_, Rich.)

Ginkgo Tree (_Ginkgo biloba_, (L.)) and several other species and
varieties of Junipers, Pines, Spruces, and Yews.




SALICACEAE—THE WILLOW FAMILY


The Willow family, which includes also the Poplars, comprises about
200 species, a large proportion of which are distributed in temperate
and arctic zones. Several shrubby species extend far into the arctic
regions.

On the whole this family is not important commercially, but with the
disappearance of the more valuable kinds of trees the rapid-growing and
easily-propagated Willows and Poplars are receiving more attention.

The 2 genera belonging to this family are given below:

=Salix=, (page 51).—This genus comprises no fewer than 175 known
species, 100 of which are native to North America. The following
species are reported from West Virginia: _S. nigra_, Marsh., _S.
amygdaloides_, Aud., _S. discolor_, Muhl., _S. humilis_, Marsh., _S.
cericea_, Marsh. and _S. cordata_, Muhl. Doubtless several other
species occur in the State. The task of determining the different
species of Willows is one for the specialist who has devoted much
time to their study. For this reason only one species, the common
Black Willow of our stream banks, is described and illustrated in this
bulletin. The most common introduced Willows are the well-known Weeping
Willow (_Salix babylonica_, (L.)) and a yellow-twigged variety of the
White Willow (_Salix alba_, var. _vitellina_, (L.) Koch.).

=Populus=.—The species of Poplars and Aspens number 27 of which 19
are native to North America and 3 to West Virginia. White Poplar
(_P. alba_, (L.)) and Balm of Gilead (_P. candicans_, Ait.) are the
principal introduced species planted in the State.

KEY TO THE SPECIES OF POPULUS

  Leaves broadly deltoid, acuminate, marginal teeth somewhat incurved;
  trees of stream banks and extensively planted along
  streets      =P. deltoides, p. 57.=

  Leaves ovate to sub-orbicular.
  Leaves coarsely sinuate-toothed, 3-5 inches long
               =P. grandidentata, p. 55.=

  Leaves finely serrate, less than 3 inches long  =P. tremuloides, p. 53.=




JUGLANDACEAE—THE WALNUT FAMILY


The Walnut family, with its 6 genera and 35 species, is represented
in North America by 2 genera (Juglans and Carya) and 19 species. This
family is a very important one, contributing much of the costliest and
most durable timber as well as large quantities of edible nuts. The
wood of Black Walnut is especially adapted to fine cabinet work and
that of the Hickories to the manufacture of vehicles, handles, etc.,
where strength and flexibility are desired.

=Juglans=.—The 15 species comprising this genus are found principally
in the north temperate zone. Five species are native to North America
and two are found in West Virginia. The English Walnut (_Juglans
regia_, (L.)) which has been introduced and widely planted in the
United States yields the valuable Circassian Walnut woods used in
the manufacture of fine furniture as well as the walnuts sold in our
markets.

to that part of North America lying east of the Rock mountains. At
least 5 of these are found in West Virginia. _Carya microcarpa_, Nutt.,
not described herein is reported from Fayette County.

The Pecan Hickory (_Carya illinoencis_ (Wang.) K. K.), a southern

  ends, dull white; bark shaggy      =C. laciniosa, p. 65.=

  Leaflets usually 5; nuts smaller, rounded or notched at
  the base, white, thin-shelled; bark shaggy      =C. ovata, p. 63.=




BETULACEAE—THE BIRCH FAMILY


The 6 genera and about 75 species belonging to this family are
principally confined to the higher latitudes of the northern
hemisphere. In North America there are 5 genera and about 30 species,
of which the 5 genera and at least 9 species grow in West Virginia. The
Common Hazelnut (_Corylus americana_, Walt.) and the Beaked Hazelnut
(_Corylus rostrata_, Ait.) are both common shrubs of the State. The
Smooth Alder (_Alnus rugosa_, (DuRoi) Spreng.) and the Hoary Alder
(_Alnus incana_, (L.) Moench.) are both to be found, the former
abundant along our streams, and the latter rare in upland swamps.
_Alnus alnobetula_ (Ehrh.) K K. is also reported from Greenbrier,
Fayette, and Randolph counties.

This family produces products of great value. The wood of Birches is
used extensively for furniture and interior finish, and for fuel. Black
Birch supplies a volatile oil of considerable importance. The wood of
some of the Alders is becoming valuable on account of its use in the
manufacture of gunpowder, and the fruits of the Hazelnuts bring a good
price on the market. The following are our tree genera:

=Ostrya=, (page 73).—Four species of Hop Hornbeam or Ironwood are
known, 2 being found in North America. One of these is limited in its
range to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, in Arizona; the other is
widely distributed and is common locally in West Virginia.

=Carpinus=, (page 75).—Eleven species of Hornbeams are native to
Asia and Europe and only 1 species is found in North America. This is
abundant in most parts of West Virginia.

=Betula=.—This genus comprises 25 known species of trees and 10
species of shrubs. About 15 of these are native to North America and
3 to West Virginia. Besides our native species the Gray Birch (_Betula
populifolia_, Marsh.) and varieties of White Birch (_Betula alba_, L.)
are often planted for ornamental purposes.

KEY TO THE SPECIES OF BETULA

  Bark of the trunk light-colored with thin layers curling or peeling off.

  Outer bark yellowish, fruits usually sessile; leaves usually rounded
  at base; twigs with slight wintergreen taste      =B. lutea, p. 79.=

  Outer bark reddish-brown, inner bark tinged with red; fruits on
  slender stalks; leaves usually wedge-shaped at base; not
  aromatic      =B. nigra, p. 81.=

  Bark of trunk rough, dark gray, without thin outer layers; bark of
  twigs with wintergreen taste      =B. lenta, p. 77.=




FAGACEAE—THE BEECH FAMILY


There are 6 genera and about 400 species of trees and shrubs belonging
to the Beech family of which 5 genera and about 60 species are native
to North America. Fourteen species of Oaks, 2 species of Chestnuts, and
1 species of Beech occur in West Virginia.

This large family is second in importance only to the Pine family and
in some respects surpasses it. Nearly all its members, especially the
various kinds of oaks, produce wood of superior quality and adapted to
a great variety of uses.

=Fagus=, (page 83).—This genus comprises, in the world, 5 species,
only 1 of which is found native in America. The others are Asiatic and
European species. The European Beech (_Fagus sylvatica_, L.), and its
varieties having purple leaves, cut leaves or pendent branches are
often planted for ornamental purposes.

=Castanea=, (pp. 85, 87).—Of the 5 or more species of chestnuts
belonging to this genus, none is found in the western part of North
America and 3 species are native to the eastern part of the United
States. _Castanea alnifolia_, Nutt., is a shrub found in the southern
Atlantic states. The European Chestnut (_Castanea sativa_), the
Japanese Chestnut (_Castanea Japonica_) and the Chinese Chestnut
(_Castanea mollissima_) are all planted in this country for their
nuts. The Japanese and Chinese species are more or less resistant to
the chestnut bark disease and for this reason they and their hybrids
with our native species are likely to receive much attention from
nut-growers. The common Chestnut and the Chinquapin, both of which are
natives of West Virginia, may be exterminated by the disease mentioned
above.

=Quercus=.—The Oak genus comprises 300 known species in the world. Of
these about 55 are indigenous to North America and 14 to West Virginia.
The Oaks belong to two classes, namely, those that mature their acorns
in one season and those that mature them in two. The West Virginia
species are grouped below according to their classes:

White Oak Class:

  1.—White Oak (_Quercus alba_).
  2.—Post Oak (_Quercus stellata_).
  3.—Bur Oak (_Quercus macrocarpa_).
  4.—Swamp White Oak (_Quercus bicolor_).
  5.—Yellow Oak (_Quercus Muhlenbergii_).
  6.—Chestnut Oak (_Quercus Prinus_).

Black Oak Class:

  1.—Red Oak (_Quercus rubra_).
  2.—Pin Oak (_Quercus palustris_).
  3.—Scarlet Oak (_Quercus coccinea_).
  4.—Black Oak (_Quercus velutina_).
  5.—Spanish Oak (_Quercus falcata_).
  6.—Scrub Oak (_Quercus ilicifolia_).
  7.—Black Jack Oak (_Quercus marilandica_).
  8.—Laurel Oak (_Quercus imbricaria_).

The following key will assist in distinguishing the species.

URTICACEAE—THE NETTLE FAMILY


The trees and shrubs alone belonging to the Nettle family number 1000
or more, most of which are tropical. The herbaceous representatives of
this family in West Virginia are mostly unimportant weeds, but the 3
genera and 4 species of trees have considerable commercial value and
are attractive ornamentally.

=Ulmus=, (pp. 117, 119).—There are about 15 known species of Elms of
which 6 are native in North America and 3 in West Virginia. The English
Elm (_Ulmus campestris_, L.) is planted for ornamental purposes. The
Cork Elm (_Ulmus racemosa_, Thomas) is reported from Summers, Monroe,
and Randolph counties.

=Celtis=, (page 121).—There are about 60 species of Hackberries, 9
being natives of North America and 2 natives of West Virginia. Besides
the species herein described _Celtis pumila_, Pursh, a shrubby variety,
grows at Harpers Ferry and other stations in the eastern part of the
State.

=Morus=, (page 123).—About 10 species of Mulberries are known, of
which 3 are native to North America and 1 to West Virginia. The White
Mulberry (_Morus alba_, L.) a native of Asia, introduced to furnish
food for silk worms, has become established in many sections.

The Osage Orange (_Maclura pomifera_, (Raf.) Sch.), a member of this
family found native in the southwestern states, has been introduced
into many sections where it is planted for hedges.

Paper Mulberry (_Broussonetia papyrifera_, Vent.), a Japanese species,
is reported from Jefferson, Berkeley, Kanawha, and other counties.
The Common Fig Tree (_Ficus Carica_, L.) is occasionally found in the
eastern part of the State where it has been planted.




MAGNOLIACEAE—THE MAGNOLIA FAMILY


The Magnolia family, comprising about 10 genera and 85 species of trees
and shrubs, is represented in North America by 4 genera, two of which
contain only shrubs. The other two include the valuable Magnolias and
Tulip Tree which not only produce large quantities of choice lumber but
are among the most desirable of our ornamental trees.

=Magnolia=, (pp. 125, 127, 129).—Most of the 25 species of Magnolias
are tropical only one venturing as far north as southern Canada.
Three species are native in West Virginia. _Magnolia virginiana_, a
fragrant-flowered species growing farther east and south, is sometimes
planted in West Virginia but is not hardy. Several shrubby and
arborescent Chinese and Japanese species are also grown for ornamental
use.

=Liriodendron=, (page 131).—The Chinese _Liriodendron chinensis_ and
our common Tulip Tree are the only known species belonging to this
genus.




ANONACEAE—THE CUSTARD APPLE FAMILY


This family is essentially tropical, only a few of the 600 species
being found in temperate regions. It has 2 genera, _Asimina_ (page
133) and _Anona_, the former having 5 species of shrubs in the south
Atlantic and Gulf states, and one tree growing in the eastern half of
the United States. _Anona_ is a tropical genus.

The trees of this family are small and the wood has no commercial
value. The fruit of our Common Pawpaw is sweet and edible, but to many
persons distasteful. The tree is highly ornamental and interesting when
growing singly or in groups.




LAURACEAE—THE LAUREL FAMILY


The Laurel family, with about 40 genera and nearly 1000 species, is
represented in North America by 6 genera, of which 4 are arborescent.
Most of the species are tropical. The 2 genera represented in West
Virginia are _Sassafras_, (page 135) and _Benzoin_, the latter having 1
shrubby species, the common Spice Bush. The Sassafras described herein
is the only member of this genus in North America. Another species is
found in China.

The members of this family are aromatic trees and shrubs, none of
which is important as a wood producer. Some of them possess medicinal
properties and all have ornamental value.




=HAMAMELIDACEAE—THE WITCH HAZEL FAMILY=


The Witch Hazel family comprises about 18 genera with 50 species most
of which are native in Asia, South Africa and North America. Of the 3
North American genera 2 are arborescent. The genus _Hamamelis_ (page
137) has 2 species in Asia and 1 herein described. _Liquidambar_ (page
139) also comprises 2 Asiatic and 1 North American species, the latter
being found in West Virginia.

The species produce hard, dark-colored and handsome wood.




PLATANACEAE—THE PLANE TREE FAMILY


The Plane Tree family has a single genus. _Platanus_, (page 141) with
about 7 species, 3 of which are native to North America and 1 to West
Virginia. Of the exotic species the Old World _Platanus orientalis_, L.
is frequently planted along streets for shade.




ROSACEAE—THE ROSE FAMILY


The Rose family with about 90 genera and 1,500 species is one of the
largest and most important families of plants, including the apple,
pear, cherry, plum, quince, raspberry, blackberry, and strawberry.
About 90 species, 30 or more of which are trees, are found in West
Virginia. The genera which include our tree species are given below:

=Pyrus=, (pp. 143, 145).—This genus comprises about 40 species of
trees and shrubs, 10 of which are native to North America and 2 or
more to West Virginia. The apple and pear, introduced from Europe,
are placed by some authors under the genus _Malus_, and Mountain Ash
under the genus _Sorbus_. The latter is included under Pyrus in this
bulletin. The European Mountain Ash (_Pyrus aucuparia_, (L.) Ehrh.) is
often planted for ornamental purposes.

=Amelanchier=, (page 147).—The Juneberry species number about 30.
About 23 of these are found in North America, 6 of which attain tree
size. Besides the species described herein, variety _botryapium_ has
been reported from Preston County and a specimen collected in Tucker
County has been pronounced by Dr. C. S. Sargent as the recently-named
_Amelanchier laeris_. A shrubby species (_Amelanchier oligocarpa_,
(Michx.) Roem.) is found in Tucker and Pocahontas counties.

=Crataegus=, (pp. 149, 151).—A few species of this genus occur
in Europe and Asia, but most of them are native to North America.
About 700 species of Thorns have been described. According to some
authorities there are fewer species than have been described, while
others affirm there are many yet to be found. Millspaugh’s Flora of
West Virginia lists 22 species, and the writer has collected several
additional species that have been examined and identified by Eggleston
and others. Because the Thorns are of little commercial importance and
are very difficult to identify only 2 species are described in this
bulletin.

=Prunus=.—This genus includes the Plums and Cherries. Of the 100 or
more species distributed in Asia, Europe and America, about 30 are
native in the United States, and 4 or 5 are found in West Virginia.

KEY TO THE SPECIES OF PRUNUS

  a. Fruit in long racemose clusters.

  Leaves 2-5 inches long; fruit purplish-black      =P. serotina, p. 153.=

  1 inch in diameter, red or yellow      =P. americana, p. 159.=




LEGUMINOSAE—THE PULSE FAMILY


The Pulse family embraces over 400 genera with about 7,350 species of
trees, shrubs, and herbs. Out of this number 100 genera with about
1,400 species are found in North America, and about 25 genera with 65
species are recorded for West Virginia. Only 3 genera with 3 species in
this State can be classified as trees.

=Gleditsia=, (page 161).—About 11 species belonging to this genus are
distributed throughout the temperate regions of Asia and eastern North
America, 3 of which are native to the south-central and eastern parts
of the United States. One is found in West Virginia.

=Cercis=, (page 163).—This genus includes 7 species of small trees
and shrubs distributed in parts of Europe, Asia and North America, 3
of which are found in the United States and one in West Virginia. The
genus is of little commercial importance.

=Robinia=, (page 165).—- This is an American genus containing 7
species, 4 of which are shrubs, one tree species being found in West
Virginia. Locusts have been introduced into Europe where they are
widely planted. The Rose Acacia (_Robinia hispida_, L.) is occasionally
planted for ornamental purposes.

The Kentucky Coffee tree (_Gymnocladus dioica_, (L.) Koch.) has been
planted in many sections of the State, and is reported by Millspaugh as
native in Randolph and Webster counties.




RUTACEAE—THE RUE FAMILY


This large family is confined chiefly to the Old World and the
southern hemisphere, and is largely made up of herbs. Four genera
have tree representatives in the United States. The species are not
commercially valuable. _Ptelea_ (page 167) is the only genus native to
West Virginia. Prickly Ash (_Zanthoxylum americanum_, Mill.) grows in
Monongalia, Jefferson, and Taylor counties, probably as an introduced
species.




SIMARUBACEAE—THE QUASSIA FAMILY


The Tree of Heaven (_Ailanthus glandulosa_, Desf.), introduced from
Asia, has been extensively planted along streets and on lawns from
which it has escaped in many places.




ANACARDIACEAE—THE CASHEW FAMILY


The Cashew or Sumach family is mainly tropical comprising about 50
genera with 500 species of trees, shrubs and woody vines. Its members
are not valuable as wood producers but in many cases they have
commercial importance on account of their acrid, milky, or resinous
juice, used in medicine, tanning, and the manufacture of varnishes and
resins, and on account of their attractive appearance when planted
as ornaments. The genus _Rhus_, (pp. 169, 171, 173) is the only one
native to Northeastern America. There are 120 known species of _Rhus_,
about 16 of which are found in North America and 6 in West Virginia.
Besides those described in this bulletin the following shrubby species
grow wild in the State: Smooth Sumach (_Rhus glabra_, L.), Poison Ivy
(_Rhus Toxicodendron_, L.) and Fragrant Sumach (_Rhus canadensis_,
Marsh.)

The Smoke Tree (_Rhus Cotinus_, L.), an introduced tree, is planted on
lawns.




AQUIFOLIACEAE—THE HOLLY FAMILY


The Holly family with 5 genera and nearly 300 species is distributed in
temperate and tropical regions of both hemispheres. _Ilex_, (pp. 175,
177) which is represented in West Virginia by 4 species of small trees
and shrubs, is the only genus of this family which is important in
number of species or is widely distributed. Our hollies, not described
herein, are Winterberry (_Ilex verticillata_, (L.) Gray), a low shrub
common in high swamps; and a rare shrubby species with long-stalked
fruits (_Ilex longipes_ Chapm.) recently collected in Randolph County.
_Nemopanthus mucronata_, (L.) Trel., also a member of this family, is a
common shrub growing at high altitudes in this State.




ACERACEAE—THE MAPLE FAMILY


This family includes only 2 genera, one of which (_Dipternia_) contains
a single Chinese species. The genus _Acer_ comprises about 70 species
distributed principally in the northern hemisphere. There are 13
species native to the United States, 6 of which are found in West
Virginia.

The maples not only produce much valuable wood but are used more
extensively than any other group for ornamental purposes. The principal
exotic species are Norway Maple (_Acer platanoides_, L.), and Sycamore
Maple (_Acer Pseudo-Platanus_, L.).

The following key will be of use in distinguishing the species:

KEY TO THE SPECIES OF ACER

7 known species, 5 of which are found in North America and 1 in this
State.




ERICACEAE—THE HEATH FAMILY


The Heath family with its 90 genera and 1,400 species is widely
distributed in tropical and temperate regions. Of the 40 genera found
in the United States 7 have tree representatives. The flora of West
Virginia comprises about 22 genera and 40 species belonging to this
family. Many of these are shrubs, the names of which are given in the
list of native shrubs beginning on page 232.

Three small trees belonging to the following genera are described
herein.

=Rhododendron=, (page 209).—This genus embraces about 100 species
of shrubs and small trees in the Northern hemisphere besides a large
number in the southern. Of the 17 or more species native to North
America only 1 reaches tree size. In addition to the species described
herein the flora of the State embraces the Mountain Rose Bay (_R.
catawbiense_, Michx.) and several species of Azaleas.

in tropical regions of both hemispheres. The genus _Diospyros_ (page
215) is the only representative of this family in the United States and
includes 2 species one of which is native to West Virginia.




STYRACACEAE—THE STORAX FAMILY


This family embracing about 7 genera and comparatively few species is
distributed principally in North and South America and in eastern Asia.
Of the 3 North American genera only _Halesia_ (page 217) is found in
West Virginia.




OLEACEAE—THE OLIVE FAMILY


The Olive family comprises about 20 genera with 500 species distributed
principally in the northern hemisphere. In North America there are 5
genera with 20 species and in West Virginia 2 genera with 4 species.
The Olive Tree (_Olea Europaea_, L.), which produces the olives used
for food, belongs to this family. This tree has been introduced into
the southwestern part of the United States. The _Syringas_, (Lilacs),
_Forsythias_, and _Ligustrums_ (Privets) are extensively planted in
this State for ornamental purposes and for hedges. The two genera
described below have representatives in West Virginia.

=Fraxinus=, (pp. 219, 221, 223).—The _Ashes_, numbering about 40
species, are distributed chiefly in the north temperate zone. Of this

given in the list of native shrubs.

[Illustration: WHITE PINE]




WHITE PINE

=Pinus strobus=, L.


=Form=.—Height 50-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk when in close
stands long, straight, and free from limbs; limbs arranged in whorls.

=Leaves=.—Arranged in clusters of 5, slender, 3-sided mucronate, 3-5
inches long, blue-green when mature.

=Flowers=.—May; monoecious; the staminate oval, light brown one-third
inch long, clustered at base of new growth; the pistillate catkins in
small groups or solitary along the new growth, cylindrical, about ¼
inch long, pink.

=Fruit=.—Cones maturing in autumn of second year, drooping,
cylindrical, often curved, 4-6 inches long, scales thin without spines;
seeds red-brown mottled with black spots, ¼ inch long with wings 1 inch
long.

=Bark=.—On young branches smooth, green, often with red tinge; on old
trunks thick, divided by shallow fissures into wide flat-topped ridges
covered with purplish scales.

=Wood=.—Soft, weak, straight-grained, easily worked, not durable in
contact with the ground, light brown with whitish sapwood.

=Range=.—Newfoundland and Manitoba to Pennsylvania, Indiana and Iowa,
and south along the Alleghany mountains to northern Georgia.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Originally abundant in parts of
Pocahontas, Greenbrier, Raleigh, and Tucker counties, and sparingly
distributed in all the counties east of the Alleghanies, and in
Gilmer, Jackson, Monongalia, Preston, Ritchie, Tyler, Wetzel, and Wirt
counties. Now becoming rare.

=Habitat=.—Prefers fertile, well-drained soil, but will grow in all
soils and situations excepting swamps and dry wind-swept ridges.

=Notes=.—White Pine is easily distinguished from all other native
species by the leaves which are in clusters of five. This tree is
one of the most valuable and beautiful of the conifers. Its wood is
extensively used for shingles, construction, cabinet work, woodenware,
matches, etc. As an ornamental tree it is especially attractive. A
fungous disease, the white pine blister rust, threatens to destroy the
species.

the Alleghany foothills of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Found locally in the following
counties: Boone, Braxton, Berkeley, Clay, Doddridge, Fayette, Gilmer,
Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, Logan, Mercer, Monroe,
Mingo, Nicholas, Preston, Pocahontas, Randolph, Roane, Summers, Tyler
and Wayne. Rare in McDowell, Wyoming, and Webster.

=Habitat=.—Prefers dry sandy soils of hillsides, sometimes found in
swamps.

=Notes=.—This is our only native pine having all the leaves in
bundles of three. It is of much less value than the White Pine but
wall often grow where other pines will not. and is resistant to fire.
Wood used chiefly for mine props, fuel, charcoal, boxes, crates,
and construction. Tar is sometimes made from this wood, and the
resin-filled knots and wood are excellent for kindling fires.

[Illustration: TABLE MOUNTAIN PINE]




TABLE MOUNTAIN PINE

=Pinus pungens=, Lamb.


=Form=.—A small tree 30-50 feet high, 1-2½ feet in diameter; trunk
sometimes with limbs almost to the ground, the lower drooping, the
upper ascending; often bearing cones when only a few feet tall.

=Leaves=.—Two in a bundle, stiff, usually twisted, sharp-pointed, 1½-3
inches long; dark blue-green.

=Flowers=.—April-May; monoecious; staminate in long, loose spikes,
anthers yellow; pistillate clustered on sides of new growth.

=Fruit=.—Cones large, oblong-conical, oblique at base, 2-3½ inches
long, hanging on for many years; scales with very stout, curved
prickles.

=Bark=.—On the trunk broken by fissures into irregular plates with
loose red-brown scales.

=Wood=.—Light, soft, brittle, coarse-grained, resinous, brown with
yellowish sapwood.

=Range=.—Pennsylvania and New Jersey to northern Georgia, in the
Appalachian mountains.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Scattered sparingly in the counties
along the Alleghany Mountains.

=Habitat=.—Usually found on dry gravelly slopes and ridges.

=Notes=.—This species is most easily distinguished from the other
pines of the State by the very large and prickly cones and by the
bundles of two stiff, short leaves. The yellow pine which has some of
its leaves grouped in twos has very small and nearly smooth cones. Not
valuable for lumber; used chiefly for fuel and charcoal.

[Illustration: YELLOW PINE]




YELLOW PINE

=Pinus echinata=, Mill.


=Form=.—From 80-100 feet high, 2-3½ feet in diameter; trunk straight,
slightly tapering; crown pyramidal or rounded; limbs not tolerant of
shade and in dense stands dropping off early leaving a long, clean
trunk.

=Leaves=.—In clusters of 2 and 3, the leaves in threes more often near
the ends of twigs; slender, flexible, 3-5 inches long, blue-green.

=Flowers=.—April-May; monoecious, pale purple, staminate flowers in
clusters at base of new growth; pistillate flowers 2-4 in a whorl near
end of new growth, pale rose-colored.

=Range=.—New York to Florida and west to Missouri and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—A scattered growth in the hilly
counties lying east of the Ohio river and in the counties along the
Alleghany Mountains.

=Habitat=.—Usually found with hardwoods and other pines on clay or
gravelly soil, on hills or stony slopes.

=Notes=.—The Yellow-Pine can be distinguished from the other pines by
its clusters of two and three slender leaves and its small cones. It
furnishes excellent lumber for commerce and is extensively used for
many purposes in buildings.

[Illustration: SCRUB PINE]

Morgan, Grant, Mercer and other counties southward along the mountains;
less common in Barbour, Boone, Fayette, Kanawha, Logan, Monongalia,
Randolph, Ritchie, Wayne and Wyoming counties.

=Habitat=.—Prefers light sandy and thin rocky soils; often found on
exhausted farm lands.

=Notes=.—This species is most easily confused with yellow pine, but
can be distinguished by its uniform 2-leaf clusters, small prickly
cones and comparatively smooth bark. The leaves are twisted and
divergent, giving the twigs a disheveled appearance. Of little value as
a timber tree; wood used chiefly for boxes, crates, fencing, ties, and
fuel.

[Illustration: TAMARACK]




TAMARACK

=Larix laricina=, (DuRoi) Koch.


=Form=.—A tree usually 30-60 feet high, 1-2 feet in diameter; trunk
straight, tapering, and having numerous slender, upward-curving
branches; crown narrowly pyramidal.

=Range=.—Newfoundland south to Maryland and West Virginia, west to
Minnesota and the Rocky Mountains, through British Columbia to Alaska.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—A few trees near Cranesville, Preston
County, growing in a swamp.

=Habitat=.—Prefers swamps and lake borders, but thrives in many other
places.

=Notes=.—Tamarack is our only native cone-bearer with deciduous
leaves. This tree has been transplanted in several places in the State
where it makes a good appearance on the lawn.

[Illustration: RED SPRUCE]




RED SPRUCE

=Picea rubra=, (DuRoi) Deitr.


=Form=.—Height 70-80 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; trunk straight,
continuous, free from limbs to a considerable height when in close

Tucker, Randolph, Pendleton, Pocahontas, Webster, Nicholas and
Greenbrier counties. Now largely removed by lumbermen.

=Habitat=.—Well-drained uplands; also on mountain tops and
occasionally on borders of swamps.

=Notes=.—Since this species is the only native spruce in West Virginia
there is no cause for confusing it with anything else. Norway spruce
has much larger cones. Originally red spruce was one of our principal
lumber trees, but when it is removed there is but little natural
reproduction. Often planted for shade. Wood used for construction,
musical instruments, furniture, aeroplanes and paper pulp.

[Illustration: HEMLOCK]




HEMLOCK

=Tsuga canadensis=, (L.) Carr.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk with limbs nearly
to the ground when in the open but free from them to a considerable
height when in dense stands; slender horizontal branches form a
pyramidal crown which is often irregular.

=Leaves=.—Arranged on all sides of the branch, but appearing as if in
two ranks, flat, thin, rounded or slightly notched at the tip, about ½
inch long, dark green above, pale beneath.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in nearly all parts of the
State, reaching high elevations in the mountain counties, and confined
to ravines and rough stony ground in most of the hilly sections.

=Habitat=.—Prefers damp stony northern exposures, deep stream gorges,
river banks, and swamp borders.

=Notes=.—The hemlock ranks as one of the most useful trees. The wood
is used for construction, paper pulp, and lath; the bark is used in
tanning; and the trees are often planted on lawns and in hedges.

[Illustration: BALSAM FIR]




BALSAM FIR

=Abies fraseri=, (Pursh) Poir.


=Form=.—Height 30-70 feet, diameter 1-2½ feet; trunk continuous,
tapering; crown pyramidal; rigid horizontal or ascending branches.

County; on the head of the Greenbrier River, Pocahontas County; and
near the head of Blackwater fork of Cheat River in Tucker County.

=Habitat=.—Grows at high elevations and seems to prefer swampy soil in
West Virginia.

=Notes=.—This species, which reaches the northern limit of its
restricted range in Tucker County, is not commercially important. The
trunks are occasionally sawed into lumber, and the tree has been widely
transplanted on lawns.

[Illustration: ARBOR VITAE]




ARBOR VITAE

=Thuja occidentalis=, L.


=Form=.—Height 40-50 feet, diameter 1-2 feet; trunk often divided;
crown compact, pyramidal.

=Leaves=.—In 4 ranks on the stems, scale-like, ⅛-¼ inch long,
longest and long-pointed on leading shoots, yellow-green, aromatic.

=Flowers=.—April-May; monoecious; staminate round, small, yellow;
pistillate larger, oblong, reddish.

=Fruit=.—Cones maturing in early Autumn, oblong, about ½ inch long,
reddish-brown, and persisting through the following winter.

of the Potomac River and on the North Fork of the South Branch in
Pendleton County. Reported from Grant and Mineral counties.

=Habitat=.—River banks, swamps, rocky hillsides.

=Notes=.—This tree, often called white cedar, is so rare in West
Virginia, and of so small a size that it has but little value, except
from the standpoint of the botanist. It is commonly planted throughout
the State for hedges and other ornamental purposes.

[Illustration: RED CEDAR]




RED CEDAR

=Juniperus virginiana=, L.


=Form=.—Height 30-40 feet, diameter 1-2 feet; crown pyramidal or
rounded, often irregular, dense.

=Leaves=.—Opposite, of two kinds: (1) scale-like overlapping
one-sixteenth inch long, (2) awl-shaped, ¼-½ inch long, less common
than the other form.

southern hilly counties. Plentiful in Jefferson, Berkeley, Morgan,
Hampshire, and in parts of Gilmer, Calhoun and Putnam counties.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rough limestone soils and dry hillsides, but grows
in a variety of soils and situations.

=Notes=.—This species is valued on account of its durable wood and
attractive appearance. During the past two or three years many red
cedars have been destroyed in the eastern section of the State in order
to stamp out apple rust which exists in one of its stages upon this
tree.

[Illustration: BLACK WILLOW]

the hairy seeds which are carried about by the wind.

=Bark=.—On twigs reddish-brown; on old trunks thick, and rough with
many broad connecting ridges, often becoming shaggy.

=Wood=.—Light, soft, brittle, not durable, very dark colored with
light sapwood.

=Range=.—New Brunswick south to Florida, west to Dakota, Arizona and
central California.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—A common tree along streams in nearly
all parts of the State.

=Habitat=.—Banks of streams and pond borders.

=Notes=.—This is the commonest and most easily recognized of the
willows. Its greatest value in West Virginia is probably the part it
plays in holding stream banks in place. The wood is sometimes used for
fuel and charcoal.

[Illustration: AMERICAN ASPEN]




AMERICAN ASPEN

=Populus tremuloides=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 30-40 feet, diameter 10-20 inches; trunk usually
continuous, supporting a rounded loose crown.

blotches below the bases of limbs.

=Wood=.—Light, soft, not strong nor durable, brownish with lighter
sapwood.

=Range=.—Alaska to Newfoundland south to Pennsylvania and along the
mountains to Kentucky, west to California and Mexico; the widest range
of any North American species.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Small trees found growing sparingly
in the mountain counties; observed in Randolph, Pocahontas, Pendleton,
Grant, Tucker, Preston and Upshur counties. Reported from Calhoun,
Gilmer, Monongalia, Mason, Summers and Wirt counties.

=Habitat=.—Prefers sandy and gravelly soils, but thrives on others;
frequent in high cut-over areas which have been burned.

=Notes=.—This tree, which is locally known as Quaking Asp, can be
distinguished from the other poplars by its finely-toothed tremulous
leaves. The species is not important in West Virginia, and is seldom
used for any purpose.

[Illustration: LARGE-TOOTHED POPLAR]




LARGE-TOOTHED POPLAR

=Populus grandidentata=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 30-60 feet, diameter 1-2 feet; trunk continuous,
tapering; slender ascending branches forming a somewhat loose oval
crown.

localities: Webster, on Elk Mountain; Randolph, Horton and Gandy Creek;
Tucker, near Davis; Monongalia, Deckers Creek; Tyler near Middlebourne.
Reported from Ohio and Preston counties.

=Habitat=.—Rich, moist, sandy soil.

=Notes=.—This tree can be distinguished by its coarse-toothed leaves.
It is comparatively rare and of little importance commercially.

[Illustration: COTTONWOOD]




COTTONWOOD

=Populus deltoides=, Marsh.


=Form=.—Height 50-100 feet, diameter 3-5 feet; trunk usually
continuous and tapering; horizontal and ascending branches forming a
long pyramidal crown.

Potomac River near Romney, Hampshire County, and near Petersburg,
Grant County. Found at a few other points along the Potomac and its
tributaries.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich moist soil, along the banks of streams.

=Notes=.—The Cottonwood, commonly known as Carolina Poplar, is the
largest of our true poplars. It is rare and of little value where it
grows naturally in the State, but is extensively planted as a shade
tree. This species is a very rapid grower but otherwise has little to
recommend it for ornamental planting.

[Illustration: BUTTERNUT]

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich, moist soils, and requires an abundance of
light.

=Notes=.—The Black Walnut is classed as one of the most valuable of
our trees on account of its superior wood. It is also prized on account
of its nuts and is sometimes planted on lawns. Where suitable land is
available this rapid-growing species may be profitably planted for
commercial purposes.

[Illustration: SHELL-BARK HICKORY]




SHELL-BARK HICKORY

=Carya ovata= (Mill.) K. Koch.

pistillate in 2-5-flowered spikes.

=Fruit=.—Round-oval, nearly smooth, 1-2 inches in diameter; husk
thick, splitting freely to the base; nut 4-angled, with a thick or thin
wall; kernel sweet and edible.

=Bark=.—Gray; on old trunks very rough, separating into long loose
strips which give the trunk its characteristic shaggy appearance.

=Wood=.—Hard, heavy, tough, strong, close-grained, pliable, light
brown with nearly white sapwood.

=Range=.—Southern Canada and Minnesota south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—A common tree except on the highest
mountains. Reported as not plentiful in Wetzel, Roane, Jackson and
Summers counties.

=Habitat=.—Thrives best in rich, damp soils, common along streams and
on moist hillsides.

=Notes=.—The Shellbark Hickory furnishes much of the valuable wood
used where strength and toughness are required. The tree is known best
to most people on account of its excellent nuts. It can be profitably
grown from seed.

[Illustration: BIG SHELL-BARK HICKORY]




BIG SHELL-BARK HICKORY

=Carya laciniosa=, (Michx. f.) Loud.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 1-2 feet. Similar to that of the
smaller shell-bark.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, compound; leaflets usually 7, sharp-pointed,
serrate, dark green and smooth above, paler and covered with soft hairs
beneath.

=Flowers=.—Very similar to those of the smaller shell-bark, previously
described.

=Fruit=.—Ovoid, with four shallow creases above the middle, 1½-2½
inches in diameter, thick, smooth husk, splitting to the base; nut
large, thick-shelled and angled; kernel sweet and edible.

=Bark=.—About the same as that of the smaller shell-bark hickory.

of the shell-bark hickory.

=Range=.—Central New York and Southern Michigan to North Carolina and
Arkansas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not common, found principally near
the Ohio River from some distance north of Parkersburg to Kenova.
Reported from Harrison, Upshur and Monongalia counties, where possibly
the trees have sprung from artificially planted seeds.

=Habitat=.—Rich, damp bottom lands and coves near rivers.

=Notes=.—Too rare to be an important tree in West Virginia. The wood
is equal to the best of other species of hickory, but the nuts are
rendered less valuable on account of the thickness of their shells.

[Illustration: MOCKERNUT HICKORY]




MOCKERNUT HICKORY

=Carya alba=, (L.) K. Koch.


=Form=.—Height 50-80 feet, diameter 1-2½ feet; trunk in the woods
straight and free from limbs for about half its length; crown round or

base; nut indistinctly angled with very hard thick shell and small
edible kernel.

=Bark=.—Gray, tight, rough but not shaggy.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, tough, close-grained, elastic, brown with
white sapwood.

=Range=.—Massachusetts and Ontario to Nebraska, Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common, especially on the hillsides
and ridges east of the Alleghanies. Less frequent and scattered in the
central and western counties.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich, well-drained soils of open wooded hillsides.

=Notes=.—This tree has very thick sapwood which is the most valuable
part of hickory wood. It is unsurpassed for handle material and other
uses where strength and elasticity are desired. The nut kernels are
of good quality but are small and hard to get. The pubescent leaf
petioles and the thick husks and thick-walled nuts form easy marks for
distinguishing this species from the common shell-bark. Big Bud Hickory
and White Heart Hickory are other names for this tree.

[Illustration: PIGNUT HICKORY]




PIGNUT HICKORY

=Carya glabra=, (Mill.) Spach.


=Form=.—Height 50-80 feet, diameter, 2-3½ feet; trunk usually
straight, clean and long; crown rounded or narrowly oblong.

layers of which sometimes become detached at one end, giving the trunk
a somewhat shaggy appearance.

=Wood=.—As in other species of hickory before described.

=Range=.—Maine, Ontario and Minnesota to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in every county, less
frequently found at high elevations.

=Habitat=.—Thrives on almost any rich, well-drained soil of ridges and
hillsides.

=Notes=.—The abundance of this species in nearly every section of the
State makes it one of the most useful hickories, especially for the
farmer. Its growth in farm woodlands, as in other places, should be
encouraged.

[Illustration: BITTERNUT HICKORY]




BITTERNUT HICKORY

=Carya cordiformis=, (Wang.) K. Koch.


=Form=.—Height 60-75 feet, diameter 1-2½ feet; trunk long and free

scurfy pubescence; husk thin, splitting half way to the base, sutures
winged at the top; nut nearly smooth with a small bitter kernel.

=Bark=.—Not so rough as in other species, but with many narrow
connecting ridges.

=Wood=.—Similar to that of other hickories but not so strong and of
less fuel value.

=Range=.—Southern Canada and Minnesota to Nebraska, Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Found in scattered growth in nearly
all parts of the State.

=Habitat=.—Prefers low ground along streams, but is often seen on
higher ground. The name, Swamp Hickory, is not inappropriate.

=Notes=.—Of less value than our other hickories, but of sufficient
worth to warrant its propagation in suitable places. This tree can
be distinguished by its more numerous leaflets and by its small
bitter-kerneled nuts.

[Illustration: HOP HORNBEAM]




HOP HORNBEAM

=Ostrya virginiana=, (Mill.) K. Koch.


=Form=.—A small tree not often exceeding 30 feet in height and 1 foot
in diameter; trunk usually straight and bearing a rounded crown of
slender branches.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 3-5 inches long, acute at apex, doubly
serrate, thin and tough, smooth above, pale and slightly pubescent
beneath.

=Flowers=.—Appear with the leaves, monoecious; staminate flowers in
drooping catkins which develop from the wood of the previous summer,
usually three in a bunch; pistillate in erect aments; each enclosed in
a bladdery bract.

=Fruit=.—Small flat nutlets, enclosed in bracts arranged in pendulous
light-green clusters resembling hops.

=Bark=.—Brownish, roughened by narrow ridges with loose flat scales.

=Wood=.—Strong, hard, tough, close-grained, durable, red-brown, with
light sapwood.

=Range=.—Cape Breton Island and Minnesota south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not common in many sections but
scattered locally throughout nearly all parts of the State. Found
usually with other species in the rougher, more elevated situations.

=Habitat=.—Rich open woods of slopes and ridges.

=Notes=.—Although this tree has valuable wood it is not sufficiently
plentiful nor of such a size as to make it an important species for
forestry purposes. It is desirable for parks and lawns. The rough,
scaly bark, peculiar fruits, and hard wood are distinguishing marks.
Its most common local name is Ironwood.

[Illustration: AMERICAN HORNBEAM]




AMERICAN HORNBEAM

=Carpinus caroliniana=, Walt.


=Form=.—Small tree, usually from 10-25 feet high; trunk short, often
leaning, fluted and bearing an irregular crown of slender, often zigzag
branches.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 2-4 inches long, thin, oval,
long-pointed, doubly serrate, dull green above, lighter beneath,
scarlet and orange in autumn.

=Flowers=.—Appear in April; monoecious; without petals; staminate
catkins 1-1½ inches long; the pistillate shorter, with greenish scales
and red styles.

=Fruit=.—Small nuts, enclosed in 3-lobed, leafy bracts grouped on a
common drooping stem.

=Bark=.—Gray, smooth, thin, tight.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, tough, close-grained, light brown with thick
nearly white sapwood.

=Range=.—Northern states to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common throughout the State.

=Habitat=.—Moist soil of stream borders, swamps and hillsides.

=Notes=.—This species, commonly called Water Beech, is of no
commercial importance, but is attractive on lawns, especially in
autumn, and performs a valuable service in preventing the caving in of
stream banks where it grows.

[Illustration: BLACK BIRCH]




BLACK BIRCH

=Betula lenta=, L.


=Form=.—Height 50-85 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk long and clear in
dense growths; crown narrow and open.

=Leaves=.—Alternate in pairs, simple, 3-4 inches long; ovate to
oblong, taper pointed, doubly serrate, dull dark green above, paler
beneath; petioles short, hairy, grooved above.

=Flowers=.—April, before the leaves; monoecious; the staminate in
pendent yellowish catkins; the pistillate in shorter erect catkins.

=Fruit=.—An oblong, cone-shaped strobile, 1-1½ inches long, erect,
3-lobed scales smooth; nutlets small, winged.

=Bark=.—Very dark and broken into thick, irregular ridges and plates;
the young and inside bark having a sweet, wintergreen taste.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, close-grained, dark reddish brown, with light
sapwood.

=Range=.—Newfoundland to Illinois, Tennessee and Florida.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Scattered locally through nearly all
parts of West Virginia.

=Habitat=.—Grows in a variety of soils and exposures, but prefers rich
moist woodlands.

=Notes=.—Black Birch is a widely-known tree and is highly valued on
account of its wood. The local names, Red Birch and Cherry Birch refer
to the appearance of the heartwood and the bark, and Sweet Birch to the
flavor of the bark. This tree can be distinguished from Yellow Birch,
which it most closely resembles, by its darker-colored bark which does
not peel off in loose flakes.

[Illustration: YELLOW BIRCH]




YELLOW BIRCH

=Betula lutea=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk short and usually
forking near the base; crown rounded, open.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, solitary or in pairs, simple, 3-4 inches long,
acute at apex, doubly serrate, dull green.

=Flowers=.—April; monoecious; staminate flowers in pendent purplish
catkins; the pistillate in shorter, erect, greenish catkins.

=Fruit=.—Cone-shaped strobiles, 1 inch long and erect, scales of
strobile downy on the back and edges; nut small, about as broad as its
wing.

=Bark=.—Silvery yellow-gray, with thin, papery layers separating
and often curling at the edges giving the trunk a ragged appearance;
slightly aromatic, and bitter. Campers often use the loose outer bark
for starting camp fires in wet weather.

=Wood=.—Heavy, strong, hard, close-grained light reddish-brown, with
nearly white sapwood.

=Range=.—Newfoundland to Minnesota and south to North Carolina.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Frequent, especially in mountain
sections, growing with spruce and hemlock; rare in low hilly parts of
the State and in the Eastern Panhandle; found along streams and in
other damp situations on the outskirts of its range.

=Habitat=.—Moist fertile uplands and along streams.

=Notes=.—This large birch is associated with other mountain species
such as Spruce, Hemlock, Black Cherry, and Black Birch. It furnishes
valuable lumber and is a rapid grower. The characteristic appearance of
the bark, described above, will prevent the confusion of this tree with
its close relative, the Black Birch.

[Illustration: RED BIRCH]




RED BIRCH

=Betula nigra=, L.


=Form=.—Height, 50-90 feet, diameter, 1-3 feet; trunk usually short,
dividing into two or three large ascending limbs; crown irregular,
oblong.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 1½ to 3 inches long, round-ovate, acute,
doubly serrate, sometimes cut or slightly lobed, deep green, pale
yellow-green beneath.

=Flowers=.—April, before the leaves; monoecious; staminate formed in
the fall and remaining over winter as short aments, usually in clusters
of three and elongating in the spring to 2-3 inches; pistillate, short,
erect, situated on twigs with the staminate flowers and back of them.

=Fruit=.—Cylindrical strobile, 1-1½ inches long; 3-lobed scales of
strobile pubescent; nuts small, hairy, winged.

=Bark=.—On old trunks dark red-brown and rough, with deep furrows and
broken ridges; on younger trees, lighter-colored, the outer papery
layers separating freely into thin sheets and turning up at the edges.

=Wood=.—Light, rather strong, close-grained, light brown with pale
sapwood.

=Range=.—New England, west to Missouri, and south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Observed growing along the banks of
the following rivers: Williams, Gauley, Greenbrier, New, Great Kanawha,
Little Coal, Elk, Guyandot, Twelvepole, Big Sandy, Little Kanawha,
Potomac, Shenandoah, Great Cacapon.

=Habitat=.—Banks of streams, occasionally on drier ground.

=Notes=.—A common name of this species, River Birch, signifies its
preference for river borders as its habitat. While the tree is not
important it serves to hold stream banks from falling in and at the
same time adds much to the attractiveness of river scenery. The bark
and leaves lack the aroma of some of the other birches.

[Illustration: BEECH]




BEECH

=Fagus grandiflora=, Ehr.


=Form=.—Height, 50-100 feet, diameter, 2-3 feet; trunk often long
under forest conditions, in the open short; crown narrow or rounded.

3-5 inches long; dark blue green above, light green and very lustrous
beneath, petioles short and hairy.

=Flowers=.—April-May; monoecious, staminate flowers in loose, light
green globose heads, about 1 inch in diameter and hanging on long,
slender peduncles; the pistillate small, 2-flowered, protected by
awl-shaped bracts, and with long red stigmas.

=Fruit=.—A prickly bur, bearing 2 or 3 triangular brown nuts about ¾
inch long.

=Bark=.—On the trunk smooth, close, light gray and mottled with darker
spots.

=Wood=.—Hard, strong, close-grained, not durable, light red, with
yellowish-white sapwood.

=Range=.—Southern Canada and Wisconsin, south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in nearly all parts of the
State; less frequent or rare locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in
Summers, Mercer, McDowell, and Wyoming counties.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich bottom lands but grows frequently on thin
gravelly slopes and flats, sometimes growing at high elevations.

=Notes=.—This is one of the most familiar of our trees, except in a
few restricted areas. It is shade-loving, and is a valuable tree in
the farmers’ woodland. The wood is used principally for novelty wares,
carpenters’ tool handles, clothespins, fuel and charcoal.

[Illustration: CHESTNUT]




CHESTNUT

=Castanea dentata=, (Marsh) Borkh.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 3-5 feet; trunk, in close stands
with few low branches and little taper; in the open having a short
trunk and rounded crown.

6-8 inches long; coarsely serrate with incurved teeth, thin, dull,
yellow-green, glabrous.

=Flowers=.—June-July; monoecious, the staminate borne in bunches at
intervals on long catkins; the pistillate borne in scattered involucres
near the base of the upper catkins.

=Fruit=.—A large prickly bur, opening at its four sutures in early
autumn; nuts usually 2-3, compressed, ½-1 inch wide, brown, sweet and
edible.

=Bark=.—Moderately rough, with shallow fissures and flat-topped
ridges, gray-brown.

=Wood=.—Soft, light, not strong, easily split and worked,
coarse-grained, durable, red-brown with light sapwood.

=Range=.—Maine and Michigan southward to Arkansas, Mississippi, and
Alabama.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Abundant in most parts of the State;
of best quality along the lower western slopes of the Alleghanies.

=Habitat=.—Thrives in most places in West Virginia, but is less
frequently seen on limestone soils and in swampy places.

=Notes=.—The Chestnut tree is prized for its lumber, its nuts, its
tannin, and for its numerous uses, especially on the farm. It is a
very rapid grower, and sprouts freely from the base of the stump when
cut down. A disease known as chestnut blight has entered the State and
threatens to exterminate this tree.

[Illustration: CHINQUAPIN]




CHINQUAPIN

=Castanea pumila=, (L.) Mill.


=Form=.—Height 20-30 feet, diameter 1-2 feet, in West Virginia usually
much smaller; trunk short, supporting a rounded crown.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 2-6 inches long, lanceolate or oblong,
narrowed at both ends, coarsely serrate, thick, smooth and yellow-green
on the upper surface, paler and covered with a whitish down beneath.

=Flowers=.—May-June; monoecious; staminate flowers in clusters along
the catkin; the pistillate borne at the base of the upper catkins in
rounded, prickly involucres.

=Fruit=.—Matures in early autumn; bur covered with stiff spines and
enclosing usually only one ovoid brown nut which is very sweet and
edible.

=Bark=.—On trunk lightly furrowed and with flat ridges broken into
light brown, loose plates.

=Wood=.—Light, hard, strong, coarse-grained, brown, with thin hardly
distinguishable sapwood.

=Range=.—Pennsylvania and New Jersey south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not widely distributed but common in
some sections. Observed in the following counties: Mercer, Wyoming,
Summers, Fayette, Logan, and Boone. Reported also from Wayne, Monroe,
Mingo, Braxton, Gilmer, Pendleton, Greenbrier, Grant and Nicholas
counties.

=Habitat=.—Dry slopes and flats and stream borders.

=Notes=.—This species is usually a shrub in West Virginia, often
bearing fruit when only a few feet high. Several trees observed south
of the Kanawha River were well-formed, 20-25 feet tall, and with
straight trunks 6-8 inches in diameter. The Chinquapin is chiefly
prized on account of its nuts. It is susceptible to the attack of
chestnut blight and may eventually be killed out by this disease.

[Illustration: WHITE OAK]




WHITE OAK

=Quercus alba=, L.


=Form=.—Height 75-100 feet, diameter 3-6 feet; trunk long and
free from limbs and with slight taper; crown broad and open with
wide-spreading and often twisted branches.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 5-8 inches long, obovate-oblong, rounded
at the apex and with usually 7 rounded lobes with entire edges, bright
green above, glaucous beneath.

=Flowers=.—May, when leaves are one-third grown; monoecious; the
staminate in long pendulous catkins; the pistillate borne above on
short stalks in the leaf axils.

=Fruit=.—Acorns maturing in autumn after flowering; cup with small
brown tomentose scales, enclosing about ¼ of the nut; nut ovoid,
rounded at apex, light brown, shining; kernel bitter-sweet.

=Bark=.—On old trunks rough with deep fissures, and ridges which are
often broken into short flat light gray scales.

=Wood=.—Strong, heavy, close-grained, durable, light reddish brown
with thin sapwood.

=Range=.—Maine and Minnesota to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Found in every county and in almost
every locality except at high elevations.

=Habitat=.—Grows on many different types of soils and from moist
bottom lands to the tops of dry ridges.

=Notes=.—The White Oak ranks as one of the most valuable timber
trees. It is known to more persons than any of our other oaks, and is
generally praised as a beautiful and useful tree.

[Illustration: POST OAK]




POST OAK

=Quercus stellata=, Wang.


=Form=.—Height 50-75 feet, diameter 2-3 feet, trunk usually short; the
crown rounded, with spreading branches.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, about 4-5 inches long, usually with five
lobes, the middle pair largest but all short and broad; thick and
leathery, nearly smooth above, covered beneath with dense grayish or
yellowish stellate pubescence.

=Flowers=.—May; monoecious; the staminate on long drooping catkins;
the pistillate short-stalked and woolly, with bright red stigmas.

=Fruit=.—Acorn ripening in autumn after flowers; cup small, thin,
hairy inside, scales flat and woolly; nut small, oval ½-¾ inch long,
brown, sometimes marked with nearly black longitudinal stripes.

=Bark=.—Similar to that of White Oak, but usually rougher and more
yellowish.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, close-grained, durable in contact with the soil,
brown with thick sapwood.

=Range=.—New England, where it is a shrub, southward to Florida and
Texas, and west to Kansas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Distributed in nearly all the hilly
parts of the State, though nowhere very common and in some sections
rare.

=Habitat=.—Prefers dry sandy or gravelly soil.

=Notes=.—The Post Oak in winter may easily be mistaken for a White
Oak, but in summer and fall the small acorns and the peculiar lobing of
the leaves assist the student in distinguishing it from other species.
It is not commercially important but should be encouraged to grow on
account of the superior lasting qualities of the wood when used for
fence posts or otherwise in contact with the soil.

[Illustration: BUR OAK]




BUR OAK

=Quercus macrocarpa=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 40-75 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk usually short,
bearing a rounded crown.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 6-12 inches long, wedge-shaped at the
base, usually crenate lobed toward the apex with deep sinuses and
rounded lobes in the middle; thick and firm, dark green and glossy
above, pale pubescence beneath.

twigs.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, durable, brownish, with
thin sapwood.

=Range=.—Nova Scotia and Manitoba south to West Virginia and west to
Kansas and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Rare. Observed in the following
localities: Hardy County, between Romney and Moorefield; Grant County,
several trees on Lunice Creek near Petersburg; Morgan County, near
Great Cacapon station. Reported from Tyler County.

=Habitat=.—Usually on rich soils near streams.

=Notes=.—This is a very large and valuable oak in Kansas and other
states but is too rare to merit much attention in West Virginia. The
beautifully-lobed leaves and large acorns will not fail to interest the
student of trees.

[Illustration: SWAMP WHITE OAK]




SWAMP WHITE OAK

=Quercus bicolor=, Willd.


=Form=.—Height 50-75 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; trunk, in the open,
usually short, supporting a broad round-topped crown; in close stands
the trunk is longer and well-formed; lower branches usually drooping.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 5-7 inches long, 3-5 inches broad,
obovate, coarsely sinuate or shallow-lobed, margins thick and firm,
smooth and shining above, paler and tomentose beneath.

=Flowers=.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; the staminate on
long drooping catkins; the pistillate few-flowered, borne above on
relatively long peduncles.

=Fruit=.—Matures in autumn after the flowers; acorns on pubescent
stems 1-4 inches long; cup deeply saucer-shaped, enclosing about
one-third of the nut, which is ¾ to 1¼ inches long, chestnut brown,
usually hairy at apex.

=Bark=.—Rough on trunks with deep furrows and flat-topped and scaly
ridges; on branches soon becoming rough, with scales which often curl
back at the edges.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, tough, light brown, with thin and hardly
distinguishable sapwood.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Infrequent. Found in the following
localities: Grant County, on Lunice Creek; Hardy, near Moorefield;
Pocahontas, near Marlinton; Greenbrier, near White Sulphur Springs;
Berkeley, on Back Creek; Randolph, near Huttonsville; Upshur, at
Lorentz.

=Habitat=.—Borders of swamps and low ground along streams.

=Notes=.—The Swamp White Oak can easily be distinguished from its near
relatives; in the winter, by the bark ridges of the small branches
and the drooping lower limbs; in the summer and fall by the wavy or
sinuate-margined leaves and the long-stemmed acorns. This tree is not
considered of much importance in this State.

[Illustration: YELLOW OAK]




YELLOW OAK

=Quercus Muhlenbergii=, Engelm.


=Form=.—Height 50-75 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; trunk usually short,
sometimes buttressed at the base; crown round-topped with relatively
short, ascending branches.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 4-7 inches long, oblong, tapering at both
ends, margins with coarse, sharp-pointed teeth which somewhat resemble
those of the Chestnut and Chestnut Oak; bright yellow-green above, pale
and pubescent beneath.

=Flowers=.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; the staminate in long
pendulous catkins; the pistillate in short spikes.

=Fruit=.—Acorns mature in autumn after the flowers; cup enclosing
about ½ of the light brown, ¾-inch-long nut; kernel sweet and more
edible than that of most other acorns.

=Bark=.—On trunks moderately rough, the light gray ridges broken into
scales; resembles the bark of White Oak.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, durable, brown with
brownish sapwood.

=Range=.—Vermont and Minnesota south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not common. Observed in the following
counties: Boone, Doddridge, Fayette, Grant, Hardy, Kanawha, Monongalia,
Morgan, Summers and Webster. This tree is more common near Petersburg,
Grant County, and on Long Island Creek, Doddridge County, than at any
other places where it was found.

=Habitat=.—River banks and limestone hillsides.

=Notes=.—The wood of this oak is inferior to that of some other
species and it occurs here too infrequently to be classed as very
valuable.

[Illustration: CHESTNUT OAK]




CHESTNUT OAK

=Quercus Prinus=, L.


=Form=.—Height 60-90 feet, diameter 3-5 feet; trunk long but usually
more or less bent and often divided, forming a loose, open irregular
crown.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 6-8 inches long, usually obovate,
coarsely crenate, firm or leathery, smooth, dark green above, paler and
finely pubescent beneath.

=Flowers=.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; the staminate flowers in
long catkins; the pistillate in short spikes.

=Fruit=.—Acorns mature in autumn after the flowers; cup thin, deep,
enclosing about ½ of the smooth, light brown, oblong-ovoid nut.

=Bark=.—Very rough with deep fissures and long, dark gray, continuous
or broken ridges; rich in tannin.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, durable in contact with
the soil, dark brown with light sapwood.

=Range=.—Maine to West Virginia and south along the mountains to
Georgia and Alabama.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common except at high elevations.

=Habitat=.—Prefers dry gravelly hillsides and ridges.

=Notes=.—The Chestnut Oak is one of our common trees in the hilly
sections and can easily be distinguished by its thick, dark-colored
bark, crenate-margined leaves and large, deep-cupped acorns. Many of
the best stands have been cut for tan bark. Rock Oak is a common name
in some localities.

[Illustration: RED OAK]




RED OAK

=Quercus rubra=, L.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 2-5 feet; trunk long and free
from limbs when standing in close growth, with a narrow or rounded open
crown.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 5-9 inches long, with 5-7 toothed,
bristle-tipped lobes, becoming narrower outward from rounded sinuses,
thin and firm, smooth, lusterless dark green above, paler beneath.

=Flowers=.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; the staminate flowers in
long hairy catkins, the pistillate on short smooth stalks.

=Fruit=.—Acorns maturing the second autumn after the flowers; cup
shallow, saucer-shaped, enclosing only the base of the nut; scales
closely-appressed and somewhat glossy; nut oblong-ovoid, 1 inch long;
kernel white, bitter.

=Bark=.—Rough with long fissures and flat-topped ridges, gray brown,
inner bark light red, not bitter.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, close-grained, light red-brown.

=Range=.—Southern Canada and Minnesota to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—A common tree in all parts of the
State. Most abundant and of superior size and quality in the high hilly
and mountain sections.

=Habitat=.—Rich loamy or gravelly soils of bottom lands, slopes and
ridges.

=Notes=.—The Red Oak is most frequently confused with the Black
Oak from which it can be distinguished by the light red inner bark,
the shallow-cupped acorns and the dull green leaves. This oak is
extensively sawed into lumber which is easily worked and capable of a
fine finish for furniture and interior work. As a tree for the park or
lawn there are few which surpass it.

[Illustration: PIN OAK]




PIN OAK

=Quercus palustris=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 50-75 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; trunk usually straight
and bearing a conic, well-shaped crown, lower limbs usually drooping
and curving upward at the tips.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, much smaller than those of the Red Oak,
with 3-7, coarse-toothed, bristle-tipped lobes, with rounded sinuses;
dark green and shining above, pale below, and smooth except for bunches
of brownish tomentum in the axils of the principal veins.

=Flowers=.—Appear with the leaves; monoecious; staminate flowers in
catkins 2-3 inches long; pistillate short-stalked and with red styles.

=Fruit=.—Acorns maturing in autumn of second year after the flowers;
cup thin, shallow, about ½ inch across, enclosing about ¼ of the nut;
kernel yellowish, bitter.

=Bark=.—Not as rough as that of most of the oaks, but with shallow
fissures and broad flat ridges.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, light-brown.

=Range=.—Massachusetts and Michigan to Virginia, Tennessee and
Oklahoma.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not a common tree. Plentiful near
Princeton, Mercer County, and less common in Hardy and Morgan counties;
doubtless growing locally in most of the counties south of the Great
Kanawha River.

=Habitat=.—Prefers low ground along streams and borders of swamps.

=Notes=.—Pin Oak leaves resemble those of Scarlet Oak, but the
appearance of the whole tree is quite different from it. The drooping
lower branches and the location of the tree most readily distinguish
it, and a comparison of its small acorns with the large acorns of the
Scarlet Oak will serve to separate the two species. It is unexcelled
as a tree for parks where it grows with a straight trunk and beautiful
rounded crown.

[Illustration: SCARLET OAK]




SCARLET OAK

=Quercus coccinea=, Muench.


=Form=.—Height, 60-80 feet; diameter 2-3 feet; trunk tapering, usually
straight; crown open, and narrow when crowded.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 3-6 inches long, usually with 7 lobes
which are deeply toothed and bristle-tipped at the apex, and separated
by oblique sinuses; thin and firm, bright green above, paler beneath,
lustrous on both sides; brilliant scarlet in the fall.

=Flowers=.—May, with the leaves; monoecious; staminate flowers on long
catkins; the pistillate on short stalks in the leaf axils.

=Fruit=.—Acorns mature in second autumn after flowering; cup deep,
covering about ½ of the nut, with closely appressed, sharp-pointed
scales, somewhat glossy or slightly pubescent, forming a fringe around
the edge which is closely appressed to the large ovoid, reddish-brown
and sometimes striate nut.

=Bark=.—On trunks resembling that of Red Oak, but with shallower
fissures and narrower ridges; inner bark reddish.

=Wood=.—Heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained, reddish-brown.

=Range=.—Maine to North Carolina and west to Minnesota and Nebraska.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in all parts of the State
except at high elevations.

=Habitat=.—Prefers dry sandy soil of hillsides and ridges.

=Notes=.—The wood of Scarlet Oak is of less value than that of several
other oaks, but is frequently used for lumber, cross-ties, and other
purposes. The tree is desirable for streets or parks and in autumn is
especially attractive.

[Illustration: BLACK OAK]




BLACK OAK

=Quercus velutina=, Lam.


=Form=.—Height 50-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk long, clear,
slightly tapering; crown spreading and rounded.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 5-10 inches long, lobes usually 7, with

=Range=.—Northern New England and Ontario, west to Minnesota and
Nebraska, south to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common throughout the State except at
high elevations.

=Habitat=.—Rich soils of slopes or drier gravelly soils of ridges.

=Notes=.—Black Oak is very common but of less value than several of
the other oaks. The lumber is similar to that of Red Oak. For the
characteristics which distinguish this oak from the species with which
it is most often confused, see “Notes” on Red Oak. Yellow Oak and Black
Jack are two local names for this oak in West Virginia.

[Illustration: SPANISH OAK]




SPANISH OAK

=Quercus falcata=, Michx.


=Form=.—Height 60-80 feet, diameter 2-3 feet; crown round-topped.

=Leaves=.—Alternate, simple, 6-7 inches long; variable in shape, with
3-7 toothed bristle pointed lobes, terminal lobes often elongated and
falcate, dark green and lustrous above, paler and downy beneath.

=Flowers=.—April-May, with the leaves; monoecious; staminate flowers
in long catkins, the pistillate on short hairy stalks.

species. In some places along the Ohio River the tree grows to a fairly
large size with a long clear trunk; in the eastern part of the State it
is usually small and scrubby. The tree is most easily distinguished by
its peculiar warty bark and by the witches’ brooms which are usually
present. The wood is often sold as Ash and is used for cheap furniture,
cooperage, crates, boxes, agricultural implements, etc. The very small
shrubby trees found in the Eastern part of the State should probably be
classed as Variety _pumila_, Muhl.

near Durbin, Pocahontas County, in Canaan Valley, Tucker County, and at
many places along the Alleghanies.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich sandy soil of stream borders and mountain
flats.

=Notes=.—The large red or yellow fruits of this thorn help in the
identification of the species and give it a very attractive appearance
in the fall. The fruits are eaten by the Ruffed Grouse and other birds,
and are sometimes used for making jelly. The spines are straight and
from 1½ to 2¾ inches long.

contact with the soil, brownish with thin yellow sapwood.

=Range=.—Pennsylvania to Georgia west to Iowa and Kansas. Naturalized
over a large area in America and extensively cultivated in Europe.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common throughout West Virginia, but
most abundant and healthiest in high limestone areas.

=Habitat=.—Prefers rich limestone soil, but adapts itself to other
soils and to almost all exposures and elevations.

=Notes=.—Black Locust, Yellow Locust, and False Acacia are other names
of this tree. According to Sargent’s “Manual of the Trees of North
America” locust trees are “most abundant and of largest size on the
western slopes of the Alleghanies of West Virginia.” It is a rapid
grower, its wood is unsurpassed for many purposes and, as a legume, it
adds fertility to the soil wherever it grows.

[Illustration: HOP TREE]




HOP TREE

Upshur, Webster and Wyoming. Rare east of the mountains and sparsely
scattered in other counties along the Ohio River.

=Habitat=.—Prefers moist soil near rivers or rich loamy and rocky
ground.

=Notes=.—Holly wood is very valuable for inlaid work, cabinet making,
interior finish, and piano keys, but the trees in West Virginia are
usually small, and afford little timber. During the holidays the
evergreen foliage with bright red fruits are much sought after. The
tree is slow-growing but is otherwise very desirable for ornamental
planting.

[Illustration: MOUNTAIN HOLLY]




MOUNTAIN HOLLY

=Ilex monticola=, Gray.


=Form=.—Height 15-25 feet, diameter 2-8 inches; a shrub or small tree
with short trunk and slender ascending branches.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Not common except locally. Found
principally at high altitudes. Common near Davis, Tucker County, and in
various parts of Randolph and Pocahontas counties.

=Habitat=.—Upland sandy flats, cool mountainsides, and swamp borders.

=Notes=.—This small tree is not important except for ornamental use.
Its bright foliage and fruits recommend it for this purpose. The
species may easily be confused with Winterberry (_Ilex verticillata_,
(L.) Gray) which often grows with it. The nutlets of the latter,
however, are smooth and smaller, its flowers are shorter-stalked and
its leaves somewhat downy beneath.

[Illustration: STRIPED MAPLE]




STRIPED MAPLE

=Range=.—Novia Scotia south along the mountains to Georgia, west to
Minnesota.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in shaded ravines and rich
slopes in the mountainous parts of the State, especially in Webster,
Randolph, Upshur, Pocahontas and Nicholas counties.

=Habitat=.—Thrives best in rich soil of rocky or sandy woods.

=Notes=.—This small maple is also called Moosewood and Goosefoot
Maple, the latter name referring to the goosefoot shape of the leaf. It
is not a commercially valuable species, but always attracts attention
whether growing in its shady mountain habitat or on the lawn.

[Illustration: MOUNTAIN MAPLE]




MOUNTAIN MAPLE

=Acer spicatum=, Lam.


=Form=.—A small tree or shrub sometimes reaching a height of 20-25
feet and a diameter of 6-10 inches.

arranged in upright, dense, somewhat compound racemes.

=Fruit=.—Early autumn; small, paired samaras, red, turning brown and
drooping when mature, in racemose clusters.

=Bark=.—Nearly smooth, light brown, thin; twigs reddish, slightly
hairy.

=Wood=.—Light, soft, close-grained, light brown, with thick sapwood.

=Range=.—Newfoundland and Labrador, south to Georgia and west to
Minnesota.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common in mountainous sections and
sometimes occurring at low elevations adjacent to the mountains. Found
growing from elevation 850 feet, in Monongalia County, to elevation
4,800 feet, in Pendleton County.

=Habitat=.—Damp mountain forests, along streams and on rocky slopes;
thrives in the shade of other trees.

=Notes=.—The Mountain Maple is often seen fruiting when only 4
or 5 feet high, but it frequently reaches tree size in favorable
locations. The wood is not found on the market. This species is one
of the most ornamental of the maples and should be planted more
generally. The erect flower spikes, small red fruits, reddish twigs,
and coarse-toothed leaves are characters that distinguish it from other
maples.

[Illustration: SUGAR MAPLE]




SUGAR MAPLE

=Acer saccharum=, Marsh.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 3-5 feet; trunk of trees in close
stands long, clear and straight; crown conical or round-topped, with
many ascending and horizontal branches.

lying west of the mountains, rare in the Eastern Panhandle.

=Habitat=.—Moist, rich soils of river valleys, coves, and high flats
and rocky loams of hillsides.

=Notes=.—The Sugar, or Rock Maple is one of our best known and most
valuable trees. Its timber is becoming more highly prized as other
species are disappearing. Interior finish, furniture, shoe-lasts and
cross-ties are among the common uses of this wood. It is the principal
species from which maple syrup and sugar are made, and one of the very
best trees for ornamental planting.

[Illustration: BLACK SUGAR MAPLE]




BLACK SUGAR MAPLE

=Acer saccharum nigrum=, (Michx. f.) Britt.


=Form=.—Height 75-90 feet, diameter 2-3½ feet; trunk and crown as in
sugar maple.

counties: Lewis, Monongalia, Randolph, Tyler, Upshur, Webster and
Wetzel.

=Habitat=.—Moist soil of river bottoms and slopes.

=Notes=.—This tree, which is classed as a sub-species of the common
sugar maple, can scarcely be distinguished from the latter, except by
the leaves which are thicker, usually dropping, less deeply lobed and
slightly hairy beneath.

[Illustration: SILVER MAPLE]




SILVER MAPLE

=Acer saccharinum=, L.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 2-4 feet; trunk usually short and
soon divided into several large, ascending branches which subdivide and

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Common along the following streams:
Potomac River and its larger tributaries, Great Kanawha, New, Elk,
Little Coal, Big Sandy, Little Kanawha, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers.

=Habitat=.—Confined to river banks and swamp borders.

=Notes=.—This species, also known as White Maple, River Maple, and
Soft Maple, is one of the less valuable of the genus. Its lumber is
used principally for flooring, cheap furniture and paper pulp. Silver
Maple is extensively planted along streets and in parks. It grows
rapidly, often becoming too large, and has a less perfect crown than
some of the other maples.

[Illustration: RED MAPLE]




RED MAPLE

=Acer rubrum=, L.


=Form=.—Height 60-100 feet, diameter 1-3½ feet; trunk usually more or
less inclined or twisted; crown rather narrow and rounded.

=Leaves=.—Opposite, simple, 3-4 inches long, about as broad, lobes
3-5, coarsely toothed, green and glabrous above, whitish beneath.

=Flowers=.—March-April; polygamo-monoecious, or dioecious; in
few-flowered clusters on shoots of the previous year; petals
linear-oblong, red or orange.

sapwood.

=Range=.—Southern Canada to Florida and Texas.

=Distribution in West Virginia=.—Occurs in all parts of the State. Not
common east of the Alleghanies.

=Habitat=.—Thrives best in swamps or on stream borders, but is found
also on hillsides and ridges.

=Notes=.—The Red Maple is especially noticeable early in spring on
account of the red flowers and fruits, and in autumn when the leaves
turn bright scarlet. The wood is used for cheap furniture, turnery, and
paper pulp. It cannot be recommended highly for forestry purposes.

[Illustration: BOX ELDER]




BOX ELDER

=Acer negundo=, L.


=Form=.—Height 40-60 feet, diameter 1-2½ feet; trunk usually short
dividing into several large, spreading branches, forming an unequal,

points along the Ohio River north of Wheeling.

=Habitat=.—Moist soils of river banks and ravines.

=Notes=.—The Fetid or Ohio Buckeye is an unimportant tree of stream
borders, confined in its distribution here principally to the western
part of the State. It can easily be distinguished when in fruit from
the common species, next described, by its prickly pods. This tree is
sometimes planted on lawns but is less desirable than its European
relative the Horse Chestnut (_Aesculus hippocastanum_).

most abundant in the mountainous sections.

=Habitat=.—Rich soil of stream banks, rocky mountainsides and flats.

=Notes=.—The wood of Rhododendron is only occasionally used for tool
handles, engraving blocks, and other small articles, and is excellent
for fuel. On account of its small size the tree is not commercially
important. It is one of the most beautiful of our native species and
has been appropriately selected as the State flower.

[Illustration: MOUNTAIN LAUREL]




MOUNTAIN LAUREL

=Kalmia latifolia=, L.


=Form=.—A shrub or small tree occasionally attaining a height of 15-25
feet; trunk stout, usually forked and bearing stiff, divergent branches

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
